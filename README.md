## Apollo

Apollo is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot for the [University of Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk). It is designed to augment our Discord server with a few of the user services available on our website.

Apollo is based loosely on the development of [artemis](rhiannonmichelmore/artemis), another Discord bot produced by a member of UWCS.
